# HoverTextChanger
HoverTextChanger is a JavaScript script that adds interactivity to your web page by allowing you to change the text of an element on mouse hover.

This script uses the `onmouseover` attribute in HTML to call the `changeText()` function when the user hovers over the element with the ID `changeText`. The `changeText` function accesses the element using `document.getElementById('changeText')` and changes its content using the `innerHTML` property. In this case, the text of the paragraph changes to "Text changed!"
